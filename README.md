# Molar Mass Calculator:
I created this repository for my TI 84 Python Calculator, to be used in Chemistry class!

# How to use:
When the program prompts you to enter a chemical compound, enter a compound only consisting of the periodic element symbols and subscripts. 
You must enter a subscript after every element. The program will not interpret 1 for an element with no given subscript.
with no subscript.

Note: Double-digit subscripts or higher will not work in this program.

Input Examples:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H2O1 -> 18.01534
  *B1(O2H2)2 -> 78.83948
  *H1(C2B1)2Fe1I2 -> 380.32797
